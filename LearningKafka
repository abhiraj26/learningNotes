# Starting with Apache Kafka 
  1. Used in a lot of applications to solve big data problems, provides the messaging infrastructure. 
  2. All about data and its movement scalibily, reliabily and big amount of data. 
  3. In data world, movement of data is called messaging. 
  4. When data stores get fulled and data need to be moved, apache kafka comes into place.
  5. Problems which lead to Kafka is : 
    1.<b> Database Replication and log movement </b> : Only Data Replication is possible in same homogeneous db and it is tight coupling that means database needs to be same schema. RDBMS it is possible only. Cumbersome to manage. 
    2 <b> ETL </b> : Lot of custom code, Scalability Challenged. 
    3. <b> Messaging Challenges </b> : If a message is lost or read, its really tough to get it back. 
      There may be Single host and local storage gets full. 
      In case of high load the consumer may becomes un responsive. 
      Writing own middleware maybe cheap at first but overall complexities increases. 
      Apache names after a German Author who writes nightmarish stories which was surreal.
